      <h2>About Our Event</h2>
      <p>
        We’re planning for <strong>JSHeroes</strong> to be the biggest tech
        Conference in Romania, dedicated solely to JavaScript. We’ll get our
        engine going with <strong>
          20 international JavaScript
          experts{' '}
        </strong>and we’ve chosen a venue that allows a crowd of up
        to <strong>500 attendees</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We kick-started the Cluj JavaScripters community in August 2015.
        Since then we’ve grown to <strong>900+ members</strong> and formed
        one of the most active knowledge sharing groups worldwide. We
        organized <strong>more than 42 Meetups and Trainings</strong> for
        the JS community in Cluj. So far we <strong>
          partnered with technical
          conferences{' '}
        </strong> to deliver high-quality JS knowledge and held an
        entire conference track for CodeCamp. What can we say, it was a
        full-house track and it was brilliant!
      </p>
      <p>
        JSHeroes is one of our dreams and the high point of an active
        community; we’re truly engaged to see it come true. <strong>
          We know
          it’s a stretch
        </strong> and it might seem crazy to organize an event
        of this international scale. We’ve considered all the risks and each
        of us decided to take personal ownership for it so that our local
        Cluj JavaScripters community evolves into a <strong>
          global JSHeroes
          community
        </strong>.
